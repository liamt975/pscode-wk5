// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a = first number
b = second number

add a + b

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if number divided by 2 is a whole number == even
if number divided by 2 is not a whole number == odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
b) avg = (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
c) if n1 greater than n2, n3, n4, n5 Then large = n1

else if n2 is greater than n1, n3, n4, n5 Then large = n2

else if n3 is greater than n1, n2, n4, n5 Then large = n3

else if n4 is greater than n1, n2, n4, n5 Then large = n4

else large = n5

if n1 is less than n2, n3, n4, n5 Then small = n1

else if n2 is less than n1, n3, n4, n5 Then small = n2

else if n3 is less than n1, n2, n4, n5 Then small = n3

else if n4 is less than n1, n2, n4, n5 Thensmall = n4

else small = n5

d) the average is when you take numbers n1 through n5, add them up, and divide by 5.

the smallest among the 5 numbers is considered the "small" number or minimum. 

the The largest number among the 5 numbers is considered the "large" number or maximum.
